<h1>Supplementary Executables</h1>

For one reason or another, these executables exist solely to placehold executable files in the repository, so you know where to place your own compiles or appropriate EXEs at without needing to refer to the Wiki as much over the file placements.

These supplementary executables should be removed from your edit of this software, as they serve no other purpose, and their SLNs are only in this repository to show they're clean supplementary executables.
