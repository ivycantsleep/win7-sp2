# What happened to Windows 7 SP2?
What happened is simple. Windows 7 SP2 has been on limbo for quite a while and GitHub suddenly fucked the repository up out of nowhere on July 10.

To make matters worse, the main developer (Ivy) does not have a working computer for the time being, and relations with the other developers (h4rl and AveragePC) have soured.

As such, the repository will be archived until she will be able to work on this again.

Once unarchived, expect a full redo of the ISO from scratch, as well as a new release system.

We wish you nothing but the best and thank you for your patience and commitment to see this project grow.
