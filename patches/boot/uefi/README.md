# UEFI for Windows 7

> [!CAUTION]
> If you wish to integrate TPM 2.0 drivers too, do that before adding our patched bootmgfw.efi! Failure to do so will result in an unbootable system!

> Paste this in <extracted WIM root>\Windows\Boot, apply the changes in NTLite and you have full UEFI Class 3 compatibility, even where UEFISeven doesn't work.
