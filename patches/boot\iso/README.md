> ! [Important]
> First get the files.

After you got the files, open up the ISO using either [AnyBurn (Whatever version)](https://www.anyburn.com/download.php) or whatever app you use.

Then, for the boot.wim, replace the boot.wim inside the ISO with the new one.
> ! [Caution]
> Make sure not to misplace it anywhere, or edit the file, or even delete the old boot.wim. Just replace it, or else you will get an blue screen with no text.

After that, replace spwizimg.dll in the iso with the new one.
Then, replace background_cli.bmp in the iso with the new one.

> ! [Warning]
> This is still REALLY experimental and a REALLY EARLY version. It still looks the same, but I expect to see this replaced later on (yeah, im pretty bad at these kind of stuff)
